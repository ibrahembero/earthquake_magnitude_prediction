#This repo contains two project one for backend using FastApi to load an existing model and then take the parameters as new input after some processing and predict the magnitude
#of an earthquake and the other project for front end using react to consume this api and send the data to get the predicted value 
#and this is the objective for this full project to gather front with back end to deploy a trained model on specific data after proces it and then put the model 
#in backend project to set an api then consuming it using front end ðŸ¦‹ ðŸŒ¹
